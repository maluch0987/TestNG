TestNG

1.what is an XML?
 Xml is a file format just like text, json, HTML e.tc

 <project>
     <message>"heelo world"</message>
 </project>


 an example for json :

 {
    "project":"project1",
    "message":"hello world"

 }

 a text file:

 the project is project1 and the message is hello world;





POM.xml:

<project>
<version> </version>

   <dependencies>


   </dependencies>


</project>


1.Maven project:
simply click on new project
select maven from options
and create a new project with a name

maven porject saves you from hustle of adding dependencies like u do in java project (adding jasrs manually)
in maven you can mention the dependency that u need from maven repo
add it in the POM.xml
reload the project
and it is there for you to use.

    <dependencies>
        <!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.github.bonigarcia/webdrivermanager -->
        <dependency>
            <groupId>io.github.bonigarcia</groupId>
            <artifactId>webdrivermanager</artifactId>
            <version>5.1.0</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>


--------------------------------------------
testNG:
Test is a tool,
it can be used to unit test, integration test e.t.c
no mian needed if u are working with testNG


Annotations:

1.@Test:
All the test cases must be written down under the annotation of @Test.


whenever u run a class , it is going to execute each and every method under the annotation of
@Test.

by deafult @Test annotation follows alphabetical order of execution of the test cases

e.g public void atestcase(); --> will execute first
    public void btestcase();-->will execute second

    the geeen tick indicates that test case has passed
    the red sign idnicates the test case has failed



@BeforeMethod annotation:

the code under this annotation is going to execute everytime before each and every @Test execution is made



@AfterMethod annotation :

the code under this annotation is going to execute after every test Method (after every @TEST)

1.What is a maven project and how does it differ from a java project?

-->Maven project we donot need any jars!!!
instead of that
-->we hvae a pom.xml in which we paste the dependencies that are needed.

2.how do we get those dependencies?
--> we hvae a maven repo and we get all the dependices from there

3.whats a maven repo?
-->it is an online storage which has all the dependecies that can be used with a maven project.

4.What kind of dependencies you need for working with a testng and selenium project in maven?
-->Selenium
-->testNG
-->WebdriverManager
-->jcommander

5.how do u place your dependenices in POM.xml?
 <dependencies>
     <dependency>
     		<groupid>org.selenium2.selenium</groupid>
     		<artifact-id>selenium-java</artifact-id>
     		<version>4</version>
     </dependency>
 </dependencies>



6.we have different annotations?
1.@Test
everytest case is going to come under this annotation

2.@beforeMethod
it executes before each test annotation

3.@aftermethod
it executes after each test annotation
